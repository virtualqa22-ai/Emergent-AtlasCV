# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

AUTHENTICATION ENDPOINTS: ✅ POST /api/auth/signup - User registration with email validation, password hashing, duplicate email prevention ✅ POST /api/auth/signin - User login with correct/incorrect credential handling ✅ GET /api/auth/me - Protected route for current user info retrieval ✅ POST /api/auth/refresh - JWT token refresh functionality. JWT TOKEN MANAGEMENT: ✅ Token creation with 24-hour expiration ✅ Token validation and authentication ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (secure) ✅ Email validation (proper format checking) ✅ Password requirements (minimum 6 characters). USER MANAGEMENT: ✅ User registration with unique email constraint ✅ Authenticated resume creation (associates with user) ✅ List user resumes (authenticated endpoint) ✅ Backward compatibility (resume creation without auth still works). INTEGRATION: ✅ All existing Phase 7-9 features work perfectly with auth system ✅ Privacy/compliance features (7/7 tests passed) ✅ Presets and validation (5/5 tests passed) ✅ Resume operations, JD parsing, ATS scoring all functional. Phase 10 authentication system is production-ready and fully integrated!"

        comment: "✅ TESTED: Cookie consent banner is now working correctly! No more infinite loop errors or red error screens. Banner displays properly, Accept All and Save Preferences buttons work, cookie preferences are stored in localStorage, and app remains stable. Minor: 'Analytics enabled' still logs twice instead of once, but this doesn't break functionality. Major improvement from previous critical state."

Optional fields configuration UI working perfectly with all 6 toggles (Photo, Date of Birth, Certifications, References, Personal Details, Hobbies). New optional sections fully implemented and accessible. Locale-specific field visibility working correctly (e.g., Singapore shows photo/certifications, proper warnings for non-recommended fields). PHASE 8 VERIFIED: Live preview system fully functional with all 3 templates (Modern, Classic, Minimal). Template switching instant and smooth. Preview mode controls (Edit/Split/Preview) working on desktop and mobile. Debounced updates (300ms) confirmed working. PHASE 7 VERIFIED: Privacy Settings modal accessible via Settings button. Local-only mode, cookie preferences, data export/delete all functional. Cookie consent banner working properly. CORE FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED: Resume building forms functional, ATS scoring active, JD matching working, mobile responsiveness confirmed. INTEGRATION VERIFIED: All phases integrate seamlessly without conflicts. Minor: Some modal overlay issues in testing environment prevent certain button interactions, but all core functionality verified through alternative methods. Overall assessment: AtlasCV Phase 9 is production-ready with excellent user experience across all features."
